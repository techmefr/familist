 * exist. That leaves Capacitor's local notifications: the operating system keeps the alarm and fires it
 * even with the application closed, without network. It is the only option that keeps the promise.
 *
 * On the web there is none. The browser's Notification API only fires if a page is alive to call
 * `new Notification(...)`; waking a closed tab needs a push service, so a server. So we do nothing at all
 * on the web, and the interface says so — better an absent promise than a broken one.
