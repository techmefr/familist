<!--
	A row that swipes: tick on one side, delete on the other.

	The background does not move, it is the row that slides over it and uncovers it. Both actions are drawn
	permanently, each on its side, and light up when the gesture has gone far enough to trigger them — you see
	what is about to happen before releasing, and can come back as long as you have not let go.

	None of this is the only path: the same actions have their button in the row, and the background is hidden
	from screen readers so as not to announce the same thing twice.

	`touch-action: pan-y` leaves vertical scrolling to the browser and keeps only the horizontal: without it,
	the page would lock up as soon as a finger landed on a row.
