 * What a `postgres_changes` event allows us to do without re-reading the whole household.
 *
 * The full re-read stays the reference: it is the only thing that can fix a divergence, and everything
 * that does not fall exactly into the cases below goes back to it. Applying a payload is only a shortcut
 * for the two tables that talk constantly — the items we tick and the messages we write. A silent
 * divergence would cost far more than the slowness avoided here.
 *
 * The other published tables (lists, prices, recipes, polls) keep the re-read. A list cannot be rebuilt
 * from its own row — `toList` needs `list_members`, which the payload does not carry — and the others
 * change too rarely to be worth the risk.
