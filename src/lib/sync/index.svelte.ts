	 * Sends one queued write: an upsert, falling back to an insert when the row does not exist yet.
	 *
	 * An upsert is `insert ... on conflict do update`, so Postgres asks the update policy as well as the
	 * insert one. Several of ours are founded on membership of the row itself — `can_access_list` reads
	 * `list_members` — and a row being created has no member yet: the trigger enrols them just after. The
	 * policy therefore refuses the very row it exists to let through, and a creation never reaches the
	 * database while the local cache goes on showing it.
	 *
	 * The second round trip is paid only on that refusal. An engine that inserted first would pay one on
	 * every change instead, and ticking an item is far more common than creating something. Nothing is
	 * conceded either way: an account that really may not write this row is refused twice rather than once.
