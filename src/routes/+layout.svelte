	 * round trips — lists, magnifier, chats, cards. Shops drop out: the create button already adds an

	 * profile are destinations you visit rarely; outside the full column you reach them through the header
	 * and the profile, in the column they get their tab like the rest.
	 *
	 * `tablet-and-desktop`: the rail and the full column, not the phone. The household — its members, diets,
	 * the switcher between households — and the weekly meal plan are rarer stops than the four daily ones
	 * but not as rare as the accounts or the profile settings, and unlike them they stay reachable from a
	 * thumb: a tablet held with both hands can spare the extra icons, a phone held in one cannot. On the
	 * phone they stay where they always were — the household tucked under the profile, the meal plan reached
	 * from the recipes screen and the create menu.

								The active tab badge is a separate element, named for the transition: it slides from one tab
								to the next during the page change. Naming the whole link would slide its text, which would
								blend into the next tab's.

								Its shape is in app.css: a pill behind the icon on a phone, a full line in the column. The
								wrapper decides, by ceasing to be its containing block beyond 48rem.

				The bottom padding used to be a flat `pb-36`: close enough to clear the create button most of the
				time, but the button's own footprint — the navigation bar plus its 58 px disc and margin — is not
				a constant, it grows with the text size just like `--fl-navbar-h` does. A page whose last card
				landed right at that boundary (the avatar hint on `/profile`, the join button on `/household`, a
				busy poll's last option) ended up with it half hidden behind the disc. The formula mirrors
				`fl-above-nav`'s so the two amounts cannot drift apart.
